# Conway's Game of Life in Ruby

## Background

While playing with the Volt framework and the Opal Ruby-to-JS transpiler, I
knocked up this browser based implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

The code is a bit over-complex, and not particularly efficient, it was purely
and experiment in how to use Opal in the browser.

## Setup

To build the css and js files run...

```
bundle install

rake build
```

Now open `index.html` in a browser.
